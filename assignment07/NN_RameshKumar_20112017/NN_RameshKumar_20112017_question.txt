Q1: What is support vector machine?
A: They are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms, 
that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis.

Q2: What is quadratic programming?
A: QP is a well-optimization algorithms to maximize a quadratic function of some real-valued variables subject to linear constraints.

Q3: Difference between support vector machine and multi-layer perceptron?
A: In MLP, model complexity is controlled by keeping number of features(hidden neurons) small.
On the other hand, SVM offers a solution to the design of a learning machine by controlling model complexity independently of dimensionality. MLP needs large data for training, while, SVM can show good performance on small data sets
