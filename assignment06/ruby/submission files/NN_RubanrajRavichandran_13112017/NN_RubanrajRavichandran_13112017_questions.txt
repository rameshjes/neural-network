Q1: What are the factors that infulence Generalization?
 
A1: 1. Size of the training set
2. Architecture of neural network
3.Complexity of problem

Q2: How to overcome oscillatory problem in case of large learning rate?

A2: We can include a momentum term in the delta function to reduce the oscillation and the new term momentum drives the gradient decent steadily towards downhill direction.

Q3: What are the two heuristics approach used to accelerate the convergence of backpropagation?

A3: 1. Every weight in the network should have its own learning rate.
2. Every learning rate should be changed from one epoch to other epoch.
