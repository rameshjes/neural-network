Q1: What are Self Organizing Maps(SOM)?
A: SOM's are network model for unsupervised learning, that combine a competitive learning principle with a topological structuring of neurons such that adjacent neurons tend to have similar weight vectors

Q2: What are SOM's algorithm essential ingredients?
A: i. Continuous input space
   ii. Topology of the network
   iii. Time-vary neighborhood function
   iv. Learning-rate parameter

Q3: What are three essential process for SOM's?
A: i. Competition
   ii. Cooperation
   iii. Weight adaptation
